    - S5, Ep22
    - "\nA rock band finally reaches fame, but one of its members, James Swan is found
      murdered in his trailer. Due to the inevitably high media profile, the city
      orders full cooperation with a TV crew which was already filming the band in
      reality-style. That makes Javier show off, Kate camera shy, while Castle pulls
      the strings, almost like a director. The team finds conflicts within the band.
      Roadie Hank Rodgers also proves a link to John Campbell, from whose abusive
      cult Swan escaped and whom he recently met and paid a small fortune cash.    "
